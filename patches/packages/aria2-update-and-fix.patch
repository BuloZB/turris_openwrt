Subject: [PATCH] net/aria2: update to 1.18.9; disable libuv

aria2 doesn't support libuv 1.x branch and build fails if libuv headers are present (which is the case if performing full build). The workaround as suggested by aria2 developer is to disable libuv and aria2 will fall back to (a more reliable) epoll mechanism.
